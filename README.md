<h1>Emergency Vehicle Identification</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The ability to automatically detect and classify emergency vehicles with traffic cameras is crucial in ensuring quick reaction to emergency situations on the road. This project aims to classify emergency or non-emergency vehicles using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). I designed four different CNN architectures and evaluate their performances on the Emergency Vehicles Identification dataset. Experimental results showed that the model with a convolution with 64 filters of 3x3 and a dense layer recorded the best classification result.  The model gave a test accuracy score of 55% under 3.22 minutes.
